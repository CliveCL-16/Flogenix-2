# 🏆 Flowgenix - Buildathon Submission Summary

## Project Overview

**Flowgenix** is an agentic AI-powered healthcare claims approval system that revolutionizes medical insurance processing through autonomous multi-agent collaboration. Unlike traditional rule-based automation, Flowgenix employs specialized AI agents that reason, collaborate, and learn autonomously.

## 🎯 Core Innovation: Multi-Agent Architecture

### The Problem
Healthcare claims processing is complex, requiring expertise across multiple domains:
- **Data Validation**: Ensuring claim completeness and accuracy
- **Eligibility Verification**: Checking patient coverage and benefits
- **Clinical Review**: Validating medical necessity and procedures
- **Fraud Detection**: Identifying suspicious patterns and duplicates
- **Final Adjudication**: Synthesizing all information for decisions

Traditional systems use rigid rules and sequential processing, leading to high denial rates, slow processing, and inability to handle edge cases.

### Our Solution: Specialized AI Agents
Flowgenix implements 5 specialized agents that work collaboratively:

1. **Intake Agent**: Validates data completeness and accuracy
2. **Eligibility Agent**: Verifies patient coverage and benefits
3. **Clinical Review Agent**: Assesses medical necessity and procedure appropriateness
4. **Fraud Detection Agent**: Identifies suspicious patterns and duplicate claims
5. **Adjudication Agent**: Synthesizes all reports for final decision-making

Each agent uses **ReAct reasoning** (Reason → Act → Observe → Repeat) and autonomous tool selection.

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

@tool
def validate_required_fields(patient_name: str, patient_id: str, 
                           procedure_codes: str, diagnosis_codes: str) -> str:
    """Agent autonomously validates claim data completeness"""
